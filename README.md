# infosec2sportsball
Collection of terrible scripts to identify security conferences happening at the same time as sports events

## WARNING
These scripts are utter garbage. Screen scraping, generated by ChatGPT and barely reviewed by someone who has no idea what they are doing.

They might:

* Hurt you
* Destroy your computer
* Kidnap your loved ones

## Usage

Run `infosec2sportsball.py`.

It will prompt you for a start and end date, as well as what sport you're looking for.
Only baseball is supported right now.

It will then run the other scripts to create the CSV files it needs, unless the CSV files are already present and less than a week old.
